- File packages/apidom-core/src/deepmerge.ts contains algorithms that we originally created

  These algorithms have been reverse engineered and adapted to support deep merging of ApiDOM structures.
- File packages/apidom-core/test/deepmerge.ts contains tests and fixtures that were originally created
  in https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/blob/master/test/merge.js to test deep merging of JavaScript Objects and Arrays.
  These tests have been adapted to support testing deep merging of ApiDOM structures.
- File packages/apidom-core/README.md contains text fragments that were originally created
  in https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/blob/master/readme.md to document deepmerge library.
  These text fragments have been amended to describe merging of ApiDOM structures.
